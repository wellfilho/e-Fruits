# Queridos avaliadores...

O projeto e-fruits faz parte do desafio para a vaga de estágio Front end na Frexco.

Um dos objetivos do desafio era usar a API da fruityvice (https://www.fruityvice.com/doc/index.html), porém, não foi possível seu uso integral devido a erro de CORS. Dado essa infelicidade, eu (José Wellington), criei um arquivo a parte para usar como o detentor dos dados presentes na API (src/data/dataFruits.js).

Em contrapartida, desenvolvi uma API intermediária para usar no projeto, tal API recebe os dados da API original e repassa para minha aplicação sem o erro de CORS, para executá-la, basta seguir os seguintes passos:

## 1. Baixar a pasta Api

## 2. Instalar as dependências com o comando 'yarn'

## 3. Rodar a API intermediária com o comando 'yarn serve'

## 4. Pronto, a API intermediária rodará no link: http://localhost:5555/api/v1/all

### Com a API intermediária rodando, o projeto executará normalmente!

### Observação: Tomei a liberdade de adicionar preços aos itens!

# Dear appraisers...

The e-fruits project is part of the challenge for the Front end internship position at Frexco.

One of the objectives of the challenge was to use the fruityvice API (https://www.fruityvice.com/doc/index.html), however, it was not possible to use it fully due to CORS error. Given this unhappiness, I (José Wellington) created a separate file to use as the data holder present in the API (src/data/dataFruits.js).

In contrast, I developed an intermediate API to use in the project, such an API receives the data from the original API and passes it to my application without the CORS error, to run it, just follow the following steps:

## 1. Download the Api folder with the files;

## 2. Install dependencies with the 'yarn' command;

## 3. Run the intermediate API with the 'yarn serve' command;

## 4. Ready, the intermediate API will run on the link: http://localhost:5555/api/v1/all

### With the intermediate API running, the project will run normally!

### Note: I took the liberty of adding prices to the items!

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
